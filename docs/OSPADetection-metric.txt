OSPADetection Metric:
The OSPADetection metric discards the objects IDs, evaluating the distance (error) between the sets of ground truth objects and tracked/detected objects at each frame.
The output distance is the averaged distance over the whole video sequence.
The output distance includes 2 components: cardinality error (OSPA_CARD) and localization error (OSPA_LOC).
The output distances/errors are reported in terms of the percentage of the cut-off value.
Note: 
Default cut-off value is 1 and default order is 1.
If the base metric is Euclidean, the pair-wise distance between 2 objects is capped and normalized by the zero-distance which is 2 by default. 
The lower the OSPADetection distance, the better the tracking/detection results.
