The file format should be the same as the ground truth file, which is a text-file containing one object instance per line. Each line must contain 10 values:
<frame>, <id>, <bb_min_x>, <bb_min_y>, <bb_min_z>, <bb_length_x>, <bb_length_y>, <bb_length_z>, <conf>, <class>

All lengths/distances/coordinates are reference to the world-coordinate with units in meter. z dimension is for the height. x, y dimensions are for the ground plane.
The world-coordinate are reference to the camera calibration matrices given along with the dataset.

For the ground truth, <conf> acts as a flag whether the entry is to be considered. A value of 0 means that this particular instance is ignored in the evaluation, while any other value can be used to mark it as active. For the tracking results, all lines in the .txt file are considered.

There is only one valid class, i.e., 'pedestrian' with classs id of 1, in this dataset.

All frame numbers, target IDs and bounding boxes are 1-based. Here is an example:

1, 0, 1.82, 0.27, -0.07, 0.59, 0.69, 1.88, 1, 1
2, 0, 1.88, 0.24, -0.09, 0.59, 0.72, 1.90, 1, 1
3, 0, 2.01, 0.21, -0.14, 0.65, 0.76, 1.94, 1, 1
4, 0, 2.09, 0.18, -0.17, 0.71, 0.76, 1.96, 1, 1
